[In which we meet something large]({% post_url /chiasmata/2025-07-09-521 %}). The bigger you are, the larger you are.

**Changelog**: Homemade Corp now have little disclaimers on all the default pages (so, not the blog posts or comic pages themselves). They claim neither responsibility nor mercy.

In other news, one of the more interesting things I did over the last ten-ish months was some [fanart](https://foreach.neocities.org/guest/2025-03-30-k25ff) for [Foreach](https://foreach.neocities.org/), a comic by my friend [Lumsel](https://lumsel.tumblr.com/) that I'd recommend you check out if you're into "comics where the artist clearly read Homestuck" as a genre. Since you read Chiasmata if you're reading this, that might be a possibility!
