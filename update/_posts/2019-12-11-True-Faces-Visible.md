[In which we see the new website!]({% post_url /chiasmata/2019-12-09-462 %})

And also the *true face* of the thing that called itself 'Bonnie'.

Welcome to the new website, by the way! There's a couple of adjustments that I'd eventually like to make, but this is pretty much how I envisioned it. We've got a *cast page,* some fun ARG things (to which I will eventually add Other ARG -- watch this space), colour-changing pages and animated text!

Have a poke around, I'm sure there's something interesting to find.
