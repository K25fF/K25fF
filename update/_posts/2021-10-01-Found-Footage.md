Merry October to all of you who celebrate. It's been a mere few months since the last update, and we're back! Let's hope I can keep up a pace at least this good going forward.

There's also been a mild retcon, bonus points to the people who discover it. It's not super plot-relevant, and doesn't change any panel contents or dialogue, but it's there.
