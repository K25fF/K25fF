DANIEL: "Daniel."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "And I think your accent sounds like it's from Australia. Is that correct?"
{:.Sam}
BONNIE: "Yes. That's right. Why didn't I know that already?"
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "We don't know. We also don't know why we're here, where the powers come from or who or what made this place."
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "Well, if we find whoever put us here, me and them are going to have words."
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "Me too. This place has a sadistic sense of humour, and I don't think we're in a position to laugh at it."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Yeah. I think we should head to the door thing by Daniel's room."
{:.Sam}
BONNIE: "There anyone else around here?"
{:.Bonnie}
AIDAN: "Nobody's being here apart from us so far."
