DANIEL: "Wait, what? No! Are you stupid? That thing will cut your arm off. Again."
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "Exactly."

DANIEL: "How about we *'use our imaginations'* or whatever garbage this place spouts, and instead get Aidan here, who can make objects out of thin air to use a long pipe or something to poke the button."

BONNIE: "Huh. That's his ability? What're the rest of yours?"

SAM: "I can control and/or create electricity and Daniel here can move objects with his mind."

BONNIE: "Cool. So, Aidan, feel up to making me a bargepole to touch that button with?"
