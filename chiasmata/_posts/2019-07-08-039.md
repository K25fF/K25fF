Let's 'BEGIN'.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
SAM: "Okay, sure. Let's begin."
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "Are you crazy? This will be a bunch more sadistic traps! I'm going to my room."
{:.Daniel}
AIDAN: "You know there's nowhere to be going but up this way?"
{:.Aidan}
SAM: "There is literally no escape apart from possibly this way. You'd just sit in that room until you died of dehydration."
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "Look, my room is safe, and more traps and puzzles are *that* way!"
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "We don't know that this way isn't safe. We haven't been given any traps that damaged us!"
{:.Sam}
BONNIE: "Ahem."
{:.Bonnie}
SAM: "Permanently, sorry Bonnie."
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "And for what? Puzzles for their own sake? What the hell is this place, to demand that we run through it endlessly, completing puzzles with nonsensical abilities?"
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Literally, what else is there to do?"
{:.Sam}
AIDAN: "Maybe we should vote on it."
{:.Aidan}
DANIEL: "I don't like this voting thing. That seems like a terrible way to run a thing, and I've said that before."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Yes, let's hold a vote. All those in favour of 'BEGINNING', raise your hands."
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "This is rigged."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Shut up and let's begin."
