CLARA: "So you were captured by the Seer more than ten years ago?"
???: "Well, yes and no. The Location should still be maintaining a consistent chronology, unless it's been damaged. It should have been twelve or so years, by my count. However, I'm not sure about how that matches up to Earth Crimson."
CLARA: "What?"
???: "I'm not sure. I keep on forgetting things. This voice has no Flesh to hold it, and no Strength to cause change. Things just fall away."
