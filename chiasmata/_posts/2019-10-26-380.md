You know, that sounds like a good idea.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
DANIEL: "What're you *doing?*" 
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "It pushed me off a thing, so I'm taking its head with me so it can't follow us and try that again." 
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "Fair enough, I guess?" 
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "Huh. I knew these things were hollow, but this is lighter than I-" 
{:.Bonnie}
