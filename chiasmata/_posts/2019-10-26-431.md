A plan occurs to you.

<div class="dialogue Bonnie">
BONNIE: "Daniel, do you reckon you could get us up there?"
</div>

OMAR: "Wait wait *wait,* I don't want the only thing between me and falling to my probable death to be Daniel's magic powers. No offense, Daniel." 
{:.Omar}
DANIEL: "Some taken?" 
{:.Daniel}
<b>BONNIE?: "</b><span class="Bonnie">You can carry us all at once?</span><b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
DANIEL: "Actually, I can avoid that! The rocks float on their own, so if I break off a chunk small enough to easily propel and large enough to hold us up when I need to take a break, it should be easy!"
