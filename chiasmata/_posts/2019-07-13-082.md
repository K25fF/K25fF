LEO: "That doesn't look good." 
{:.Leo}
JACQUELINE: "How strong is that wall?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEO: "I don't know. The ghosts told me that the closed rooms had a core of some 'dark substance' in, which prevented them getting through. When the doors open, it disappears." 
{:.Leo}
CLARA: "That must be so the only way out is through the puzzles." 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "That's cool and all, and probably bears more thinking about, but that sort of pales in comparison to the fact that someone is *breaking the wall down.*" 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEO: "Can't you extend the field? Stop him doing any more damage?" 
{:.Leo}
JACQUELINE: "Not for very long. What we need to do is work out what to do when our friend here busts through the wall."
