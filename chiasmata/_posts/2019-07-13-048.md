SAM: "Bonnie, can't you do something?" 
{:.Sam}
BONNIE: "Um, I dunno, mate. Even if I can heal other people, I don't seem to instinctively know how." 
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "*Don't touch me!*" 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Hey, hey. Daniel. *Daniel!* Listen to me!" 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "*Stop that!*" 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "There is nothing to gain in freaking out right now! Take deep breaths. Stop using your power."

A quiet moment that feels like an age passes.

DANIEL: "It's not itching any more. I think it might go away." 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "You're calm now?" 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "As much as one can be when your skin is literally fragmenting." 
{:.Daniel}
AIDAN: "You know, as much as this place wasn't being nice and all, it's being much worse now. We've got regeneration with inhuman limbs and telekinesis with skin cracking."

BONNIE: "So which one of you and Sam wants to go first?" 
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "We're *still* doing this?" 
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "Dan, we don't have much choice."
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "It's *Daniel*, and I see your point." 
{:.Daniel}
AIDAN: "I'll go next."
