Let's be diplomatic, here. He looks like he's about to attack you or bolt.

SAM: "Okay. We're not here to harm you."
{:.Sam}
???: "You are!"
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "*We're not.* My name is Sam. This is Aidan. We're friendly, okay?"
{:.Sam}
???: "What is this place?"
{:.Daniel}
AIDAN: "Neither of us are knowing at the moment. We've both got amnesia of some kind. D'you have it too?"
{:.Aidan}
???: "I don't trust *either* of you. I'm not saying."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Well, I understand your mistrust! It's perfectly reasonable, given the circumstances."
{:.Sam}
???: "So you *aren't* trustworthy!"
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Wait, no! That wasn't what I said! Please hear us out! If there's more people, sticking with us'll be safer than striking out on your own! Also, we may have information you need."
{:.Sam}
???: "What sort of information?"
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Well, we know that you don't know you're from somewhere called America. Or the USA, maybe."
{:.Sam}
???: "Yes. That's true, but useless information."
{:.Daniel}
AIDAN: "Who knows, in this place. Anything could be useful."
{:.Aidan}
???: "Hmm. What do the pair of you do?"
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "You first. That looks like telekinesis or something."
{:.Sam}
???: "Hm. Maybe."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Um. Well. I do electrical things."
{:.Sam}
AIDAN: "And I make things."
{:.Aidan}
???: "Well, that sounds 'useful'."
