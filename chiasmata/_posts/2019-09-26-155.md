ASH: "I don't know. Maybe there's more stuff dribbling down my face." 
{:.Ash}
DAWN: "Well, your eyes are still a bit..." 
{:.Dawn}
ASH: "What?" 
{:.Ash}
DAWN: "Green? But that's not new, it looks like some of your veins are standing out and-" 
{:.Dawn}
ASH: "My eyes are green? Why's that weird? Can't eyes normally be green?" 
{:.Ash}
DAVID: "Ah, what Dawn means to say is that your eyes are *solid* green. Sorry, I thought you knew." 
{:.David}
ASH: "Oh? *Oh.* I - Ah, w-what are we going to do about Anders?" 
{:.Ash}
DAWN: "Maybe if I shield him and block his line of sight while we explain what's going on." 
{:.Dawn}
DAVID: "Are you okay with that?" 
{:.David}
DAWN: "It's not like I could put a hand over his eyes. I don't know if that would count as him *'seeing'* me or not." 
{:.Dawn}
ASH: "Should we wake him up?"

DAVID: "I think it might be dangerous to, but I could check."
