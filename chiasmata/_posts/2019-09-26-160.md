It's frosted glass. You can't see through.

And the doorknob's on this side, plus there's nothing of interest on the other side (just more dumb weird writing, you checked) so you might as well open it.

Unless it's locked or something. What would the purpose of a locked door be here, of all places?

Actually, come to think of it, why is this door here?
