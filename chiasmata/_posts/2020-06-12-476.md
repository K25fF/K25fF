SAM: "Yeah, it's clear."

ASH: "Okay. Hi, everyone. More weird robot things?"

SAM: "This one looks a bit different. It's all separated and stuff."

CLARA: "No, no, in this weird green-sky place."
{:.Clara}
SAM: "Huh. Is that why that one's big?"
{:.Sam}
BONNIE: "I don't think so. The big one was pretending to be me for a bit."
{:.Bonnie}
SAM: "But it's *huge!*"
