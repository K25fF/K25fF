The sound of rain dies away, and then it's just the occasional creaks of the building around you.

There's a pause before anyone speaks.

<div class="dialogue">
CLARA: "Is it over?" 
{:.Clara}
OMAR: "Maybe." 
{:.Omar}
DANIEL: "Probably not." 
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "Was that *weather?* From that weird green sky outside?" 
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "Well, some of that sounded like rain."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Then was the crashing noise *thunder*?" 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "You tell me. You're the lightning one." 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "I have the ability to *produce* lightning, not *detect* it."
{:.Sam}
OMAR: "Felt more like an impact than lightning. It shook the building. Maybe we were hit by something."
