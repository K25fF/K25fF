You head left, towards the diamond symbol on the corridor corner. Beyond the symbols, it heads off to the right.

The circle-within-circle corridor is much the same, from what you saw of it.

You would do the maze thing of drawing a line down the left of the corridor and then making sure you didn't retrace your steps, but you don't have a stick or a pen or something.
