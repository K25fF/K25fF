DAWN: "No, I'm wearing trousers. And pants, just - It's just that - Well, remember when David said something about powers having downsides?" 
{:.Dawn}
DAVID: "No." 
{:.David}
ASH: "Yes." 
{:.Ash}
DAWN: "Well, I think that there's some sort of... Weirdness with my legs. I suppose it's kind of spreading up my back too." 
{:.Dawn}

ASH: "Are those bird legs?" 
{:.Ash}
DAWN: "I don't know. It was really gradual at first, and then it was just easier to hide them than to wait until the changes went away." 
{:.Dawn}
DAVID: "This is really scary. I said something about powers and consequences and *immediately forgot*, and now Dawn has lizard legs." 
{:.David}
DAWN: "*Lizard legs?*"
