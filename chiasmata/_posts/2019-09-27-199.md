SAM: "Should we, I dunno, take a closer look at it?" 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "What, no!" 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Where's your sense of adventure, then? There's no other way out of this room." 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "*My sense of adventure?* How is that applicable here? I don't want to go anywhere near the ominous thing which says 'here lies the flesh of Arbiter' on it. I get the strange feeling that it isn't a good idea!" 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "What else are you suggesting? And *put that door down,* you'll put someone's eye out." 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "I... Alright. I don't know what else to do. And, look, the door's down. Tada. Happy now?" 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Yes. And, well, I can at least take a look at the slab a bit closer up." 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "Don't. Help me check the walls for any secret doors." 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Can't you just... *tell?* With your powers?" 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "*Apparently not.* It's easier to tap the walls and listen to whether it's hollow or not than shove my - my energy through the walls." 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "*Guh,* okay." 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "And be quiet."

You are about to move to the tedious task of pressing your ear to the wall, but something interrupts you.
