CLARA: "Hmm." 
{:.Clara}
BONNIE: "Anything interesting?" 
{:.Bonnie}
CLARA: "Not sure? I mean, it's definitely in English, and I understand *most* of the words, but putting them all together? Bit tricky. Plus, there's all these black bars over bits of it."

OMAR: "Are they about anything in particular?"

CLARA: "Well, this one's called 'design of the Reality Engine', and uses the word 'quantum' a lot, I guess? There's some pictures of weird machines, I think, and something like a more complicated version of that three-circles picture from the poster. Fuchsia, Crimson and Scarlet are what they're called, apparently? Maybe? The labelling's a bit weird."
