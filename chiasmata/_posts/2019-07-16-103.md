Unsurprisingly, both people who are left look reluctant, to say the least.

JACQUELINE: "Okay. If neither of you are going to step forwards, explain why you're being hesitant." 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "Um..." 
{:.Clara}
OMAR: "I maintain that it's too dangerous for me to do it before anyone else. I want you all out of the way." 
{:.Omar}
CLARA: "Well, my fumes are flammable, so it'll be made worse if I do my thing." 
{:.Clara}
OMAR: "Well, everything near there is going to be on fire once I'm done, so you best get your thing done first." 
{:.Omar}
CLARA: "Well-" 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "Look, Clara, whatever that's going to happen is going to be cosmetic, and probably non-permanent." 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "I'm not worried about that! Well, maybe a little." 
{:.Clara}
OMAR: "I'm actually rather worried that I'll set the wall on fire, given that I set small bits of the floor on fire temporarily with much colder flames. So I'd hope that I was the one who unlocked the door for us to escape." 
{:.Omar}
CLARA: "And you'd just run out, leaving a floor melted to lava and us trapped!" 
{:.Clara}
OMAR: "Don't you trust me?" 
{:.Omar}
CLARA: "*You* don't trust us!" 
{:.Clara}

What do you say?
