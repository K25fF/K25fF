OMAR: “Is there actually a *reason* to try to get into this room?”

DANIEL: “I mean, the robot Bonnie might have been trying to stop us, so maybe that means we’re onto something?”

SAM: “I mean, why don’t we just... look inside?”

DANIEL: “It’s locked, and we don’t have the code.”
{:.Daniel}
SAM: “Daniel.”
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: “Oh *right!* Ash could probably melt through the lock or something.”
{:.Daniel}
SAM: “*Daniel.*”
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: “Hmm? *Oh!* You’re kinda electric. Maybe you could zap the keypad or something, make the door unlock?”

SAM: “***DANIEL!***”

DANIEL: “What?”
