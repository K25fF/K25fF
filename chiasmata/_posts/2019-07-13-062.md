Yes. You've try your utmost to not stick your hands in any crackling flames. You can feel the heat from here, darn it.

You try speeding up one of the fires in a little bubble, and it disappears. That's good, you suppose. It must quickly use up all the available oxygen or something.

There's still a scorch mark, though. Eh. It can't burn the... concrete? Concrete-like substance? Pseudoconcrete? You're not sure. It looks a bit like concrete, but it's smoother and more evenly coloured, and it doesn't seem to be painted.

Now, where is the person who set everything on fire? Are there any other people? You hope they're okay.
