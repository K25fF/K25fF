Ash joins you over near the tear in the wall.

The air in the other room ripples, and an odd-looking figure steps out of the darkness.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
<b>???: "</b>Hello, David. And Ash.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
</div>

Its voice sounds strange, uninflected. And it's got an odd reverb, like a number of people are talking at once.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
DAVID: "Um, hello?" 
{:.David}
ASH: "Who are you? And how do you know our names?" 
{:.Ash}
<b>???: "</b>This is... Wait, *I* am a proxy of the archive. That is, to clarify, the thinking machine that controls the Location. This - I mean I - am a form built of some discarded materials that the fabrication engines discovered. I know your names because they are entries in the memory of the archives.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
ASH: "Why do you want us to go through this portal?" 
{:.Ash}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>I am gathering the subjects in the Location, due to a rather energetic altercation between my uncle and... <b>ᴇʀʀᴏʀ, ᴅᴀᴛᴀ ɴᴏᴛ ғᴏᴜɴᴅ."</b> 
{:.Robot}
DAVID: "And what, now?" 
{:.David}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>Correct. I am in the process of retrieving two of your fellow subjects, who were dangerously close to the altercation at its beginning, without allowing any of it to spill over into this place of relative safety.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
</div>

That sounds... really worrying. An "altercation"?
