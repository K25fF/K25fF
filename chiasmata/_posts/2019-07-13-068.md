???: "Clara. Clara Lopes." 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "Is that Spanish?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "No. I don't think so." 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "Do you have any memories from before being here?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "Not really. Are you from Britain? I cannot quite place your accent." 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "No, but I think I've been told that before." 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "What can you do? Are you stopping things moving?" 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "I can make things speed up or slow down. Time manipulation or something. What can you do?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "I can make gas. It is a pretty useless power against someone who can make fire out of nowhere, and someone who can make ghosts." 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "Maybe it's poisonous or something. Either way, I'm sure it's not useless." 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "Thank you. I will - like it says - use my imagination." 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "Yeah. What do we do now, then?"
