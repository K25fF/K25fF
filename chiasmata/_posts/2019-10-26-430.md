DANIEL: "It looks big and grey and square, so *maybe* it's that place where we started? The Location?" 
{:.Daniel}
OMAR: "Did we ever *leave* the Location?" 
{:.Omar}
DANIEL: "Is there actually an outside? That Archivist person was very *confusing* about some of the weird dimensional alternate-earth stuff." 
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "So this place, where we are, is a location that *isn't* the capital-L-Location? Maybe?" 
{:.Bonnie}
OMAR: "That's kinda convoluted. What about the numbers? And some other symbol I don't know?" 
{:.Omar}
CLARA: "Mm-hmm. Those sure are some symbols I can't read from this distance." 
{:.Clara}
DANIEL: "So, what's wrong with *your* eyes?" 
{:.Daniel}
CLARA: "Can you read it, though?" 
{:.Clara}
DANIEL: "... no." 
{:.Daniel}
