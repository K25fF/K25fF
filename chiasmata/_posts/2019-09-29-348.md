Your brain twinges with mild recognition at that phrase.

<b>ARCHIVIST: "</b>The Location's shadow itself hangs between two Earths, dangling from the 'true' Location like a... well, like a parachute, maybe? Or a shadow, or a dragline, or a surface layer extending in a direction *kata*, and honestly analogies in your language kinda break down. Took me ages to explain to... haha, well, you don't want me to prattle on about digressions.<b>"</b>

SAM: "Are you going to save the Earth...s?" 
{:.Sam}
<b>ARCHIVIST: "</b>I certainly hope so! We won't be able to continue our work if the Location ceases to be, and I won't be able to talk sense into my siblings!<b>"</b>

ASH: "Question: why were you killed before the rest of your siblings?" 
{:.Ash}
<b>ARCHIVIST: "</b>Ah. Well, we had a vote, and it was two to one against me. Brother Dearest was still fuming about, er, *certain past events,* so he voted to kill me *forever.* Sister Dearest said no, and also that that was pretty much impossible, and Sibling Dearest tiebroke by saying that it'd be most *harmonious* if I was put away for a million years, or until another sibling woke me up. I think something went wrong, though, because I certainly wasn't in exile, as I expected from that.<b>"</b> 
{:.spook}
ASH: "That's... an unusual approach to conflict resolution, by my experience here." 
{:.Ash}
<b>ARCHIVIST: "</b>Well, I guess that's a human perspective. And I did, er, take some liberties with the retelling, to make it easier to comprehend. And also because my memory is flaky. I think I lost some somewhere.<b>"</b>
