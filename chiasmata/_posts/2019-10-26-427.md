BONNIE: "Waking up in that grey, square room?"

DANIEL: "What if... *What if* when Bonnie grew her arm back the first time, *another Bonnie* grew back from the arm?"

<b>BONNIE?: "</b><span class="Bonnie">That sounds kinda gross.</span><b>"</b>

CLARA: "Would it even work? That might mean that every time you, I dunno, lose a hair or something, you'd grow a new Bonnie. That hasn't been happening, though, so I'm not sure."

DANIEL: "Huh. Maybe we can test it?"

<b>BONNIE?: "</b><span class="Bonnie">Yeah, no. Thanks, but no thanks.</span><b>"</b>
