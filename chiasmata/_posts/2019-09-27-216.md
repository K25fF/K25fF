As you head down the *supposedly less unsafe* path, a thought occurs to you.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
BONNIE: "Wait, why are we trusting this stuff written on the walls?" 
{:.Bonnie}
CLARA: "I dunno." 
{:.Clara}
BONNIE: "I think it's because it's not the same old Location stuff, you know? The *official* writing." 
{:.Bonnie}
</div>

And thank goodness for that.
