The Archive's tone doesn't stray from cheeriness as a bunch of robots start dragging a giant spiky lump of stone out through the portal.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>Not at all! This is an entirely coincidental shell-corpse these syst- I mean, I, found! The resemblance to the Admins is completely coincidental.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
DANIEL: "Yeah. *Sure.*" 
{:.Daniel}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>I am glad you believe me. It is certainly a very uncanny resemblance. Almost too close to be a coincidence.<b>"</b>

ASH: "You said something about the... façade of the Location?" 
{:.Ash}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>I did! It is to be replaced, which is why I am gathering most of you here. It will prevent injury or death when the façade is replaced.<b>"</b>

</div>
