You are somewhere.  
You are someone.  
There is a **door**. Closer to the **door**, there is <span style="color: #A9A9A9">light</span>.  
Behind you, there is **darkness**.  
In the cold **darkness**, you feel the <span style="color: #ff4500">warmth</span> on a faceless face.  
The **door** is an exit. But all exits are entrances, also. But backwards.  
It's somewhat strange, philosophically.  
You conclude, in the sense that you have always known (and thus, not really in the sense of 'conclusion' at all), that you are dreaming.
<br><br>
Dreams aren't real. Except that isn't true. Dreams are an expression of the electrical patterns of your brain, and those are certainly real. Real in the same way as words are. Symbols. Representative.

So, here's a **door**. An entry or an exit, or maybe both.

What do you do?
