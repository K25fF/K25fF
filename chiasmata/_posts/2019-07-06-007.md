Hmm. There's nothing around that looks like it needs power, so... you touch them together? They do sort of extend, like they're kept in reels or something. And if they're kept in reels, connecting and disconnecting them should make them spark if there's power running through them.

That fact seemed to jump into your brain unbidden.

Nothing happens. There's no sparks or anything. They don't appear to be powered.
