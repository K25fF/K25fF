You kneel down and lean out over the water, to see if the bottom's in sight and...

Is that what you look like? Your eyes... they're weird. It's very strange. You don't have any specific memories at all, and of your eyes in particular, but you have a strong feeling that this isn't what your eyes look like. Or, well, *looked* like.

That aside, you can't see the bottom.
