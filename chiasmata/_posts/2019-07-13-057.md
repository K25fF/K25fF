Your name is Jacqueline Jones, and nothing makes sense.

Where is this place? Why don't you remember anything? Who put you here?

And what in the name of all that is holy does this sign mean? You first tried looking at the puzzle and thinking laterally, but really the thing is impossible.

Imagining a bunch of dumb things like 'A WAY OUT' or 'A NICE HOLIDAY' didn't really help either.
