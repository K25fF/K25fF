As soon as you turn toward the door four things you could loosely call 'puzzles' appear, along with some helpful directions.

BONNIE: "Oh you have got to be kidding me. That thing's almost as deep as an arm."
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "Ouch. So mine's a little wheel thing? How is that even a puzzle? Why are we even calling these things 'puzzles'? They should be called 'challenges' or 'cruel and stupidly unimaginative ways of demonstrating that, *yes*, we have special powers'. Gah."
{:.Daniel}
AIDAN: "Maybe the simple puzzles are about showing us what the powers can do. Testing the limits, maybe? Who wants to go first?"
