The puzzle, and then the whole table, fold up, twisting dizzyingly into something that doesn't make full sense.  
It's hovering above the ground, but contains a hole that seems to disappear far further downwards than makes sense.

You are about to lean over it to take a better look, when Ash stops you, pulls you backwards.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
ASH: "Don't you *hear that?*" 
{:.Ash}
SAM: "Hear what?" 
{:.Sam}
ASH: "*That!*" 
{:.Ash}
</div>

You strain your ears for a moment, and then you hear it.

Scraping noises from the impossible hole. Drawing closer.
