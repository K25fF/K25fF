JACQUELINE: "Leo, did you take a look through the door?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEO: "The dark void stuff is behind it. And have you seen down the tunnel in Clara's puzzle? It's at least a few metres long." 
{:.Leo}
JACQUELINE: "So, the door is really thick?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEO: "Or the stuff on the other side of the door *isn't on the other side* until it opens." 
{:.Leo}
CLARA: "You have no way of proving that." 
{:.Clara}
LEO: "It's possible. With the rate things are going today, anything is possible."
