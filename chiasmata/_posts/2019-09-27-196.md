It's a room. With actual walls and floor and *that void stuff was giving you the willies, let's get to solid ground.*

And it's that eye symbol again. It's been in a bunch of places. It tickles the back of your memory. Something to do with... something.

That wasn't a very helpful half-memory.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
SAM: "Do you know what that symbol means?" 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "No. It's probably a label of where we need to go or something." 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "What, down there? So there'll be stairs or something?" 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "Dunno. Look, there's more graffiti." 
{:.Daniel}
</div>

Oh look, there is. More smiley faces from this weird person who knows your name.

...

*Wait, how did they know your name?*
