???: "My name is Leonardo Liguori."

JACQUELINE: "Ooh. Are you Italian?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEONARDO: "Yes. How did you know that? I didn't know that." 
{:.Leo}
CLARA: "I think we can recognise accents, but not our own accent. Do you know where I'm from?" 
{:.Clara}
LEONARDO: "Ah... You sound like you could be from... Um. Somewhere?" 
{:.Leo}
CLARA: "Jacqueline said I sounded Spanish, but I don't think that's true." 
{:.Clara}
LEONARDO: "You're right. You don't sound Spanish. Um..." 
{:.Leo}
JACQUELINE: "Hey, can we quickly duck into a room, rather than discussing this in a corridor. I don't want to get incinerated any time soon. I'll block the door. Where's that ghost going?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEONARDO: "To find the fire guy. I think we should get in the nearest room, though."
