They open their eyes. You lose any pretence that they might be human. They don't move right, and their eyes are empty.

You mean, Anders and Ash have odd eyes too, but theirs at least kinda... *looked* like they were seeing you, sorta. You can barely meet this person's gaze without the sense that someone is rifling through your being like it's an old book.

SAM: "Um, hello?"

<strong>???: "..."</strong> 
{:.Robot}
DANIEL: "Do you think it's part of this place? Would it react to powers?" 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "I can hardly shoot lightning at them! That's definitely hostile! Poke it with telekinesis or something."

There's a small flicker of orange light, and the creature rocks gently backwards.
