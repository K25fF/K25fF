CLARA: "I can feel the surface." 
{:.Clara}
LEO: "What?" 
{:.Leo}
JACQUELINE: "With your hand? I think we can all do that." 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "No, it's not like that. It's really hard to express in words! I know where the wall is, even behind me. I can feel it right up until it reaches the other walls, and I know it's there, even if I close my eyes." 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "Is that why there's gas coming out of the wall there?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "Yes! I thought that I could only do it out of my skin, but I think I can do it from anything I'm touching." 
{:.Clara}
LEO: "Are you turning the wall into gas?" 
{:.Leo}
CLARA: "I don't think so. I felt the wall abrading a little, but I think that's because the gas is corrosive. There's definitely more gas produced than wall damaged."
