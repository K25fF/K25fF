ANDERS: "What? I can speak? And who said that?" 
{:.Anders}
**???: "I did, friend Mind Reamer!"**

ANDERS: "The glass ball thing? What are you?" 
{:.Anders}
**???: "Wow rude! I am a *who*, not a *what!*"**

ANDERS: "Who are you, then?" 
{:.Anders}
**???: "I don't know. I know that I have a name, but I lost it. I'm not all here."**

ANDERS: "What?" 
{:.Anders}
**???: "I have... extra bits. I am a voice but there is other things somewhere."**

ANDERS: "Do you know where the other bits are? Can I help you with that, maybe?"
