DAVID: "You haven't really explained wh... why... um."

<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>Yes? You have a query?<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
ASH: "Doesn't that hurt?" 
{:.Ash}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>What hurt?<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
ASH: "Arms don't... *normally* bend like that." 
{:.Ash}
LEO: "Also, your eyes are bleeding. And nose. And ears." 
{:.Leo}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>Ah. The scaffold upon which this shell was fabricated is starting to reject the mechanical intrusions into its biological systems.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
ASH: "Biologic- you mean that thing's *alive?* I assumed it was some robot thing made to look like a human!" 
{:.Ash}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>Incorrect. It is not alive. I believe it has been dead for approximately two quadrillion, three hundred and five trillion, forty-three billion, six hundred and fifty-four million, five hundred and twenty-eight thousand, eight hundred and three seconds. The margin of error is one point eight five nine one three seconds, almost intolerably large.<b>"</b>

LEO: "That sounds like a long time. But if it's dead, why is it still bleeding?" 
{:.Leo}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>Simple; it's trying to come back to life.<b>"</b>
