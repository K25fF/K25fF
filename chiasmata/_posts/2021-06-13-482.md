The interior of ‘Security’ is relatively untidy. Someone left a stack of black rectangles — *tapes*, right — on one of the tables. It feels like it’s been a while since you’ve seen any of those.
There’s also a bank of screens in a kinda old-fashioned style. This building is probably fairly old, from what you’re seeing.
