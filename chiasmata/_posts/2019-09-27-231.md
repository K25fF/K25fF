CLARA: "They're *pretty damn similar.*"

BONNIE: "They're pretty different from these clothes the Location made us." 
{:.Bonnie}
CLARA: "Exactly! Even the robots are in clothes that are pretty similar to what we're wearing but you're in this strange spiky-collared robe with an eye on it." 
{:.Clara}
<b>???: "</b>Well, if it's *that* you're talking about, you find them in boxes after completing the twelfth trial. Or was it the sixteenth? Anyway, the Seer broke all that so it doesn't work any more, so that's why you haven't seen any so far. You're just in the basic Location clothing.<b>"</b>

CLARA: "*Hmm.* 'Special hidden clothes'? *Really?*"
