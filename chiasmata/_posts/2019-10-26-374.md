You get something of a feeling - you *could* climb down some of this, but it'd probably be tricky. The rock-stuff has enough handholds, but... you're still hesitant, and it feels like a small memory from a life you're not remembering is trying to reach the surface.

So, for now, you shelve the idea of climbing down. It looks a bit too high, maybe.
