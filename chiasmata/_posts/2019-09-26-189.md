SAM: "Can't you, I dunno, *break the wall down?*" 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "It wouldn't help. The unbroken bits of the wall are lined with that black stuff." 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "What? Why's there a hole then? It doesn't make sense." 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "I'unno. Maybe the black glass stuff turned up later? Anyway, can you fit through? I could lift you through if you wanted." 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Okay. Drop me and you're dead." 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "If I *do* drop you, it's hardly a great distance."
