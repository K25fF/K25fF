It's Leo, a horrifying phantom that looks a bit like him if you squint, and... Anders, wasn't it?

LEO: "Ah, sorry for butting in, but Anders isn't waking up. I'm not sure what to do." 
{:.Leo}
ASH: "He did do this before. I'm not sure if it's a bad thing or a good thing, but he talked in someone else's voice for a bit when he woke up." 
{:.Ash}
DAVID: "I'm still not sure what that was all about." 
{:.David}
ASH: "Do you know, Archive?" 
{:.Ash}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>I don't believe so. The memory trap, or possibly another factor explains why he collapsed, but I do not know where any additional words would come from.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
LEO: "Memory trap? What's that?" 
{:.Leo}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>The archive system that separates subjects from their memories.<b>"</b>
{:.Robot}
ASH: "Could we get our memories back?" 
{:.Ash}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>You receive them when you complete your tasks and leave the Location.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
ASH: "Well, what are our tasks, then?" 
{:.Ash}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>I... am not authorised to access that information until all the subjects are gathered, prior to a change of fa√ßade.<b>"</b>
