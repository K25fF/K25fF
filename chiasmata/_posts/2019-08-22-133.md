ASH: "The man with words said something about a door." 
{:.Ash}
DAVID: "An exit? That'd be great, but I though Dawn said this place is sealed." 
{:.David}
DAWN: "That just means I didn't notice the exit because it was sealed." 
{:.Dawn}
ASH: "There is a door. The man with words saw it. He tried to explain it to me." 
{:.Ash}
DAWN: "What? He just spoke weird whispery words in my head and made me use my power until he couldn't see me and the effect was broken, then I ran away." 
{:.Dawn}
DAVID: "What's even going on here. Like at all. What are these powers, where did they come from, and *what are we here for?*" 
{:.David}
ASH: "No-one knows. Our memories are gone." 
{:.Ash}
DAWN: "Are you sure? I mean, I knew that David here was from South Africa, and I kind of know where you're from... um..." 
{:.Dawn}
DAVID: "England?" 
{:.David}
ASH: "*No.*" 
{:.Ash}
DAWN: "Maybe? I don't know? Is it in the same area, like America is for me?" 
{:.Dawn}
ASH: "Very different. What will we do about the door?" 
{:.Ash}
