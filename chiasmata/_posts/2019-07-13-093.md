JACQUELINE: "Leo, can you have a look around with some ghosts?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEO: "Curiosity, then. Okay. I'll guard us too." 
{:.Leo}
???: "Where do we even go now?" 
{:.Omar}
CLARA: "I think that place opposite Jacqueline's room. It sort of looked like a pair of doors." 
{:.Clara}
???: "Maybe we should bring some of that dismembered robot with us." 
{:.Omar}
CLARA: "Why?" 
{:.Clara}
???: "We may need it to... unlock something? On second thoughts, it may come back to life. So no." 
{:.Omar}
LEO: "Didn't we kill it?" 
{:.Leo}
???: "Who *knows?* It keeled over as soon as we even scratched it, and it's got no visible means of support!"
