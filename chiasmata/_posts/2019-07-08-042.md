You somehow knew it wasn't going to be that easy.

AIDAN: "Well, that didn't work."
{:.Aidan}
DANIEL: "That actually suggests that the door is intelligent. That's worrying. Maybe we're being watched."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "If the door reacts like that, we're almost certainly being watched."
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "*Oh God.*"
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Hey, why don't we try to trick the door! Daniel can ram the rod in when it opens, too fast for it to close."
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "No! That's stupid. What if it manages to close the hatch before the stick hits? Then it'll shatter or something and spray out as a cloud of extremely dangerous shrapnel."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "*Oh.* Don't do that, then. That would be bad."
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "..."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Shut it. Bonnie, do you still want to go first?"
{:.Sam}
BONNIE: "Not relishing it, but sure. I'll see if I can get a proper arm back for my right arm."
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "Aren't you going to use your other arm instead?"
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "Why?"
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "Um... symmetry?"
