You round the corner to find someone with two hands. Waaaaait...

<div class="dialogue">
???: "Um, hey. Sorry for startling you. It hurts more than you'd expect to grow a hand back."
{:.Bonnie}
SAM: "Where did all the blood go?"
{:.Sam}
???: "I'm not sure."
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "Why have you got an extra thumb?"
{:.Daniel}
???: "Um, it came with the new hand. The glove thing repaired itself, too."
{:.Bonnie}
AIDAN: "Ew."
{:.Aidan}
SAM: "But anyway, hello there! You're the last of the people in this place, although there was a possible door thing next to Daniel's room. What's your name?"
{:.Sam}
</div>

She sounds Australian and a bit confused and scared, as one is when they grow their hands back badly. What's her name, then?
