You are in a room separate to the rooms in which the past two chapters began.

You don't know this, obviously. You don't know much of anything at the moment.

You're in a room you don't recognise, wearing clothes you don't recognise. Actually, you can't remember anything that happened prior to you waking up in this room.

Oh wait. You remember one thing, one sole item in this endless confusion. Your name.

What was it again?
