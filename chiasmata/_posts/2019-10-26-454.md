OMAR: "Why these numbers in particular?"

DANIEL: "Call it a hunch, I guess."

</div>

Nothing happens.

<div class="dialogue">
DANIEL: "Darn, that'd have been cool if I'd just *known* the code." 
{:.Daniel}
<b>BONNIE?: "</b><span class="Bonnie">I mean, how many combinations could there be, anyway?</span><b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
<b>???: "</b>There are ten thousand 4-tuples of the numbers zero to nine.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
</div>

There's a brief moment while that information sinks in.

<div class="dialogue">
DANIEL: "Do any of you know what a 'tuple' is?" 
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "Nope. But if there's ten thousand possible codes, I don't think we'll be able to simply *guess* it." 
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "No, I think it's *weird* that the word 'tuple' just came up randomly. *What's even happening?*" 
{:.Daniel}
<b>???: "</b>It must be connected to your lost memories.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
</div>

Daniel has a think about it, and seems to calm down.

<div class="dialogue">
DANIEL: "I think I must have heard it sometime before I lost my memories. Yeah, that sounds right." 
{:.Daniel}
<b>BONNIE?: "</b><span class="Bonnie">Fair enough, I guess.</span><b>"</b>
