Another robot creature, pressed up against the wall, falls to the ground.

You could have *sworn* you hadn't seen another one.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
CLARA: "*Gah!*" 
{:.Clara}
BONNIE: "... *Huh.* Did anyone see where that came from?" 
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "No?" 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "I thought there was *one.*" 
{:.Sam}
</div>

It clatters to the floor, all the same.
