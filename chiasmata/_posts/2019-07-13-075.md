JACQUELINE: "So, Leo - can I call you Leo?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEO: "Sure." 
{:.Leo}
CLARA: "Does Jacqueline shorten to Jack?" 
{:.Clara}
JACK: "No! Well maybe, but not for me. For me, it shortens to... Um..." 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEO: "Jacques?"
{:.Leo}
JACQUES: "I don't think so." 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "I think our problem here is memory, Jacqueline." 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "Yes. *Anyway*, Leo, how do your powers work? Do bits of your hands die, and that's why they go grey and numb or something?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEO: "No? I don't have any memories, but I know somehow that there weren't powers 'before', wherever and whenever that was." 
{:.Leo}
CLARA: "Whoever made this place wants us to 'USE OUR IMAGINATION', so maybe the powers require, um, lateral thinking." 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "Yeah. They also seem to have a sadistic streak, putting a bunch of people in a box with a guy with a much more dangerous power."
