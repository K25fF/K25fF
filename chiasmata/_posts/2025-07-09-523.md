You have collated some informative notes, probably. Hopefully?

<div class="dialogue">
SAM: "So, the squared circle and the circled square are odd." 
{:.Sam}
BONNIE: "Clara and I saw a circled triangle - it was called 'the centre'." 
{:.Bonnie}
ASH: "Does that symbol mean me, or my power, or what?" 
{:.Ash}
SAM: "Not sure we know?" 
{:.Sam}

Glaring at it intensely doesn't seem to be solving anything.

<div class="dialogue">
SAM: "Was one of us secretly a linguist in their past life?" 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "No?" 
{:.Daniel}
OMAR: "I'm going to go check if there's anything on the roof. There's a set of stairs just across the corridor, I won't be going far." 
{:.Omar}
SAM: "Uh. Maybe you shouldn't go on your own?" 
{:.Sam}
OMAR: "I will be fine." 
{:.Omar}
SAM: "Right, but, uh. What if there's more, like, mimic-people wandering around? We should do, um. Pairs? At least, right?" 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "Buddy system?" 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Is that what it's called?" 
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "Well, no, it's called Obscura Protocols, I think." 
{:.Daniel}
DANIEL: "Wait, why do I *know* that?" 
{:.Daniel}
OMAR: "Because you weren't a linguist. Now, who wants to come be a 'buddy' with me while I go look and see what hit the roof?" 
{:.Omar}
