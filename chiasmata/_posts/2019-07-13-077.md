JACQUELINE: "I suppose we should be prepared for meeting this guy. We need to get as many advantages, as many force multipliers as possible." 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "Force multipliers?" 
{:.Clara}
JACQUELINE: "It just feels right to say it, okay?" 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEO: "I should prepare some ghosts, then." 
{:.Leo}
JACQUELINE: "Yes. Maybe some... uh, cautious ones, or sneaky ones to scout him out, and some violent ones to distract him." 
{:.Jacqueline}
LEO: "Maybe vigilance? Alertness? I don't know if that'd work." 
{:.Leo}
JACQUELINE: "Well, get all the ghosts together that you can. We're going to try to negotiate, but if it doesn't work, I'll freeze him and we can duck back in a room." 
{:.Jacqueline}
CLARA: "Um, guys?"
