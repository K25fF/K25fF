<div class="dialogue">
DANIEL: "So, what do we do now?" 
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "Watch another tape? This was interesting but not *vital,* right?"
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "And the other ones are going to be vital?"

SAM: "There's a couple others that might be good."

<div class="dialogue">
OMAR: "Maybe we should go see if we can get to the roof? I'm concerned that we don't know what all that rain and thunder was about." 
{:.Omar}
CLARA: "A storm?"
{:.Clara}
ASH: "Weird green sky storm?"
{:.Ash}
OMAR: "I don't like that we've been sat here too long. Stuff could be happening where we can't see it, and I still don't think that was actually a storm."
