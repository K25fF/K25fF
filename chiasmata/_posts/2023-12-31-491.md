Dr Hemsley steps out of frame, and the camera rotates until a large, well-lit room comes into view.

HEMSLEY: “Here it is. As an object, it *appears* to be made of a dense tungsten alloy, but our attempts to determine its composition have been stymied by its indestructibility – the only known example of a nonhuman, primary-powered entity. It was found in rocks that have been radiometrically dated to four hundred and fifty-seven million years before present day, in shales containing fossils from the period of the Cambrian Explosion, indicating that it was placed at the bottom of a shallow sea, covered up by the sediment that became the stone. So, where did it come from? Who or *what* placed it here? As far as anyone in the Syndicate has been able to determine, this is a genuine artifact – a ten-tonne obelisk from a period of time when the largest animal in the world was maybe a few feet long.”
