The darkness lifts, and you are standing in a room.

On your own.

Aw hell, *not again.* This is what the stupid Location meant when it said splitting the group would be <span class="Robot">**"UNNECESSARY"**</span>.

There's a hole in the wall to another room, and what looks like a *friendly welcoming message* that someone has scribbled over in greenish faded paint stuff.

You hear a muffled voice from the next room.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
DANIEL: "Stupid damn place, back to square one, *argh!*" 
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Daniel!" 
{:.Sam}
</div>

Okay, make that not completely alone again. Not quite back to square one.
