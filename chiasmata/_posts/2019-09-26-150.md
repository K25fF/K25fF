DAVID: "Er, I think he doesn't have the power to handle the information he gets from people he controls." 
{:.David}
DAWN: "He must, or he'd get sensory overload and fall over from seeing the same thing from loads of angles." 
{:.Dawn}
DAVID: "Well, yes, but I think part of my power is getting information about things I touch. And that sort of backfired on him?" 
{:.David}
ASH: "What did you learn about your test?"

DAVID: "No, then. It's not what I expected of a speaker, really. It's a flat piece of really dense metal, which has a 'voice'. It's really abstract and I don't think it's made of, like, *technology.*" 
{:.David}

{:.Ash}
DAVID: "I'm not sure. I don't even know how I'm meant to 'silence' this thing, *anyway.*"
