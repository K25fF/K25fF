Um... The scream was something like surprise. But it also had pain in it. It wasn't despair.

<div class="dialogue">
SAM: "Come on! We need to help them!"
{:.Sam}
AIDAN: "Okay!"
{:.Aidan}
DANIEL: "Not on your life! At least be cautious rather than running into the lion's den or whatever."
{:.Daniel}
</div>

That's a lot of blood. Good thing none of you seem to be haemophobic.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
DANIEL: "Looks like they suffered an injury just before they ran off that way, past... Sam's room, I suppose."
{:.Daniel}
AIDAN: "Can we take a look at the inside of this room first?"
{:.Aidan}
SAM: "Just a peek, because there's a bleeding person to help wandering around!"
{:.Sam}
