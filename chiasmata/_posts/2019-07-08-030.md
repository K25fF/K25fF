This is very weird.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
SAM: "It doesn't look like anything. Is there anything behind it?"
{:.Sam}
???: "No, or at least I can't tell if there is. It doesn't 'register' as being made of matter to my power. I can't move it or tell if I can move anything behind it."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "It looks like a hole in space or something, but its solid. Also, I didn't catch your name."
{:.Sam}
???: "I didn't tell you."
{:.Daniel}
</div>

Well, what *is* his name?
