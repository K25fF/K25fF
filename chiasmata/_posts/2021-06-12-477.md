SAM: “Well, it was invisible, wasn’t it?”
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: “No, I couldn’t *feel* it either.”
{:.Daniel}
SAM: “What?”
{:.Sam}
BONNIE: “He did this thing earlier where he pressed his face against a door, closed his eyes, and told us what was on the other side. I mean, he *could* have been making it up, but he seemed very confident. Also the door had a warning sign, so...”
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: “Did I *really* look that ridiculous?”
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: “I’m not going to answer that question because I don’t want to make you feel bad.”
{:.Bonnie}
SAM: “*So!* What’s this weird ESP you’re talking about, then, Daniel?”
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: “Oh, uh. I can ‘see’ things when I don’t have, er. Line of sight, I think? Like, I know when people are there when I’m not looking at them or they’re too far away to see clearly. And I didn’t detect this robot-thing before.”
{:.Daniel}
SAM: “So it wasn’t there?”
{:.Sam}
CLARA: “Or intangible.”
{:.Clara}
ASH: “Maybe we should ask the next one.”
{:.Ash}
DANIEL: “Are you volunteering to face down the next rampaging robot-thing and *ask questions?*”
{:.Daniel}
ASH: “No. I wouldn’t know what to ask.”
