DANIEL: "Look, I don't like you two and neither of you like me."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "I don't actually *dislike* you *per se*, you just seem pretty cross all the time."
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "Rule one: don't attack me. I don't care how much infighting there is, but I don't want to have to fight anyone."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "So generous."
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "*Rule two:* don't follow me around like a pair of braindead sheep. I am not going to be the leader of this little triumvirate of twits. And me."
{:.Daniel}
AIDAN: "You sure you're not one of the twits?"
{:.Aidan}
DANIEL: "Yes I am sure. And rule number three is that you pair of idiots do what I say."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Not on your life."
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "What? That is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask."
{:.Daniel}
AIDAN: "I think the people who aren't you win on the grounds that there are more of us."
{:.Aidan}
DANIEL: "I don't think that's a very good way to make decisions. Nothing will get done."
{:.Daniel}
SAM: "Well, I have the impression that democracy works best out of available systems."
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: "How do any of us know? We have no memories!"
