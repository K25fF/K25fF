You go up to the robot that faces the tunnel you entered the room by.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
SAM: "Hello? Can you hear me?" 
{:.Sam}
<strong>???: "..." </strong> 
{:.Robot}

SAM: "Is it a robot or some-AH!" 
{:.Sam}
</div>

Sparks jump from your fingers of their own volition, and the sigil on the robot's head turns blue.

There is a low whirring sound, as if from a great distance.
