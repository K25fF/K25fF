With pretty much everyone gathered, you are now briefly Sam, for simplicity of second-person narration.

<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>In order for many of the repairs I am planning to occur, I need to replace the façade of the Location. It will enable the conservation of power and possible debugging of power sources. Thus, I need to gather everyone to a position where I can... insulate them from the change of façade.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
SAM: "Why?" 
{:.Sam}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>Data indicates that unprotected humans would not survive the raw concepts of the Location when unconstrained by the façade.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
DANIEL: "Doesn't that imply that you murdered a bunch of people in the name of scientific enquiry, in order to work this out?" 
{:.Daniel}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>No. I believe it was my uncle who ran the experiments.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
DANIEL: "Your uncle? I thought you said you were a computer." 
{:.Daniel}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>Yes, but I was created, and my ᴅᴀᴛᴀ ɴᴏᴛ ғᴏᴜɴᴅ creator had a brother. Ms Hallet and Lopes met my uncle, if my surveillance is correct.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
BONNIE: "He removed all my blood and then stuck a spike through my head." 
{:.Bonnie}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>Yes! It was at that point that he was engaged by a rogue shell, and I managed to sneak the pair of you away from the fighting.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
DANIEL: "Is that why your eyes look weird?" 
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "They look weird?" 
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "They're kinda... golden? With these cool-looking flecks in and slit pupils." 
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: "Huh. Cool." 
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: "*Anyway!* Distractions aside, where are the other two? Aidan and... Omar, was it?" 
{:.Daniel}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>Yes! Mr Byrne is partially incorporated into the mass there, and-<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
SAM: "Wait, *partially incorporated?*" 
{:.Sam}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>Yes. Time is somewhat short, but I can work on freeing him when these processes have finished.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}
SAM: "Can he even breathe?" 
{:.Sam}
<b>ARCHIVE: "</b>At the moment, my information indicates that he does not need to.<b>"</b> 
{:.Robot}

Well, that's kinda reassuring.
