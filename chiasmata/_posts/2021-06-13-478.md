BONNIE: “What’ve you and Ash been doing since you got in here?”
{:.Bonnie}
SAM: “This *building,* or the weird green-sky floating-island place outside?”
{:.Sam}
BONNIE: “Did you do anything outside the building?”
{:.Bonnie}
SAM: “Not really. Just getting out of a weird spherical... prison, I guess.”
{:.Sam}
BONNIE: “Inside the building, then!”
{:.Bonnie}
SAM: “Ash melted a hole through the wall so we could get in.”
{:.Sam}
ASH: “Yes.”
{:.Ash}
SAM: “And then we went right. It felt like the *right* — heh — the right way to go, when you don’t know which way to go?”
{:.Sam}
ASH: “I thought the way you're supposed to go if you're lost is left.”
{:.Ash}
DANIEL: “Okay, well, we obviously also came through the hole you made. I don’t remember what the map said was *right* of the entrance.”
{:.Daniel}
SAM: “There’s a *map?*”
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: “Uh, yeah. What was over that way, anyway?”
{:.Daniel}
ASH: “Locked doors, mostly.”
{:.Ash}
SAM: “The ‘Briefing’ one wasn’t locked.”
{:.Sam}
ASH: “There wasn’t anything there, though.”
{:.Ash}
SAM: “Yeah, it was just a big table, some chairs and stuff. I didn’t know I was *expecting* anything from a room called ‘Briefing’, but it *was* what I was expecting.”
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: “I remember now, that was on the map.”
{:.Daniel}
SAM: “How did I *miss* the map?”
{:.Sam}
ASH: “We went the wrong way.”
{:.Ash}
SAM: “But right *is* the right way!”
{:.Sam}
ASH: “Clearly not.”
{:.Ash}
DANIEL: “Please, not again.”
{:.Daniel}
SAM: “Heh, sorry. So you guys ended up here?”
{:.Sam}
DANIEL: “Yeah — the security room here seems promising, but the door’s locked, we got attacked by false Bonnie, and then you turned up — thanks for that, by the way.”
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: “And then we did a recap!”
{:.Bonnie}
DANIEL: “Shush.”
{:.Daniel}
BONNIE: “*You* shush.”
