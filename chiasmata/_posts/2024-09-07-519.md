Meanwhile, blissfully unaware, you watch Dr Hemsley finish her presentation.

HEMSLEY: "-- lack of fossil evidence in the same beds of anything else suggests a level of *detachment* from the physicality of the world at the time. Apparently the creature, creatures or civilisation that created the Stele leave no tracks or dead bodies, just a single obelisk. It's disappointing, but sometimes in science, one has very little information to extrapolate from. Certainly the Stele Glyphs are impossible to translate through mortal means; there are very few superhuman abilities that interface directly with *language,* and fewer still that can work on a fragment this small, or a language this abstract. Research is ongoing."
