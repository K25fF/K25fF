You've noticed that touching things gives you little flashes of insight, maybe some kind of extra sense that goes with your powers. It's why you blacked out briefly and apparently said you knew something when Ash was having her power side-effects before. Admittedly, you did immediately forget what you learned.

Either way, as soon as your fingers cross the boundary, you get something of an idea as to how this works. Something about folded space, something that cuts breaches and... not much else.

You're considering stepping through and having a better look around, when you see motion in the distance, through the breach, and hear a different, familiar voice.
