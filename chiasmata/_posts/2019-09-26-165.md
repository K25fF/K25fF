Okay, Anders. Control your breathing, and root around in your head to find the off switch.

You can feel your power in the back of your mind like a prickling awareness. You know there are three other people behind you, but you also know they're inaccessible.

Maybe just contract your sphere of influence until it's just you?

You can already feel your brain tingling.
