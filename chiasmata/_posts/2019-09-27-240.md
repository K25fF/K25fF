You wake up, lying on a cold, hard, floor.

Briefly, you have no idea where you are, who you are, or why everything hurts so much.

And then he starts talking, and you remember.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
<b>ARCHITECT: "</b>Ah! Back in the land of the living, I see! Quite the tenacious ability you've got there.<b>"</b> 
{:.spook}
BONNIE: "Hgkk..." 
{:.Bonnie}
<b>ARCHITECT: "</b>Don't worry, dear, these pedestals are for *preservation,* after all.<b>"</b> 
{:.spook}
BONNIE: "Ghhhkr." 
{:.Bonnie}
<b>ARCHITECT: "</b>You'll live, and that's the fun part!<b>"</b> 
{:.spook}
BONNIE: "..." 
{:.Bonnie}
<b>ARCHITECT: "</b>Don't look at me like that, you bought this upon yourself. Plus, she tried to stick her thumbs in my eyes, and that was frankly *rude.*<b>"</b> 
{:.spook}
</div>

Everything hurts and you can't move. Architect is standing there like some gigantic smug... *tall thing.*

Waves of sharp, prickling pain move down your still-numb limbs.

*Why can't you move?*
