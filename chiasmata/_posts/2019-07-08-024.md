SAM: "Um, am I right in assuming you have a weird power thing? I mean you said so before, but that could have been any ability."
{:.Sam}
AIDAN: "That I have. 'Twasn't the most welcome of surprises. I can make things."
{:.Aidan}
SAM: "What sort of things?"
{:.Sam}
AIDAN: "Green, solid things. Like this. Not as visually impressive as yours, I guess."
{:.Aidan}
SAM: "Ooh. And it said 'SPARK' above my door. On the outside, that is. Yours says 'SOLID'. If there's more people, they probably have description thingies like that!"
{:.Sam}
AIDAN: "Oh, so it does. Wasn't noticing that."
