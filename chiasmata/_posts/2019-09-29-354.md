They reach upwards, and then *everything goes wrong.*

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="dialogue">
SAM: "Wh... what? *WHAT?* What are you doing?" 
{:.Sam}
<b>ARCHIVIST: "</b>Er, well... Don't think about it too hard.<b>"</b> 
{:.spook}
ASH: "*My eyes won't focus!*" 
{:.Ash}
<b>ARCHIVIST: "</b>Probably for the best.<b>"</b> 
{:.spook}
</div>

Space itself seems to warp and ripple nauseously as they do... *something?* It's honestly hard to tell.
