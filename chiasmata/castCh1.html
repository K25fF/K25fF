<h3>Chapter 1: Eukaryote</h3>

<p>Characters are presented in order of appearance.</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/chiasmata/images/cast/01 - Sam.png" alt="Sam" style="margin-top: 1px">
        <h4>Samira 'Sam' Lane</h4>
        <p>Has fallen into the role of protagonist, and is surprisingly okay with this. Prefers to maintain a cautious optimism about the nonsense to which she has been exposed, of late.</p>
        <p><b>Electrokinesis</b> — <b>Crystallisation</b> (Ildith II)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/chiasmata/images/cast/02 - Aidan.png" alt="Aidan">
        <h4>Aidan Byrne</h4>
        <p>Was once accused of being ‘a people-pleaser’, and that his unwillingness to rock the boat would lead to ‘dark places’. That didn’t happen (it was his insatiable curiosity that led him there, actually), but it stuck with him.</p>
        <p><b>Lithogenesis</b> — <b>Hardening</b> (Ildith I)</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/chiasmata/images/cast/03 - Daniel.png" alt="Daniel">
        <h4>Daniel Fleming</h4>
        <p>His natural prickliness is being eroded, since he’s surrounded by a bunch of people who are actually friendly. In time, he might lose that ‘difficulty working in groups’ and ‘not a team player’ that they complained about on all those performance reviews.</p>
        <p><b>Telekinesis</b> — <b>Fragmentation</b> (Ildith-Echo I)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/chiasmata/images/cast/04 - Bonnie.png" alt="Bonnie" style="margin-top: -2px">
        <h4>Bonnie Hallet</h4>
        <p>Grew up a relatively short distance from a barely fenced-off jungle full of literal nightmare monsters, which has somewhat affected her ability to process and assess risk. The fact that this exclusion zone was also in Australia probably didn’t help.</p>
        <p><b>Regeneration</b> — <b>[Unknown]</b> (Lamarck-Kafka VI)</p>
