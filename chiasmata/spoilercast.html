        <h4>Architect</h4>
        <p>The first of the Location's mysterious builders to be introduced. Smiles all the time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/chiasmata/images/cast/ARCHIVIST.png" alt="Archivist">
        <h4>Archivist</h4>
        <p>Seen first in Anders' vision, then inhabiting a robot. Was dead for a bit, and remains the sibling we don't talk about.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/chiasmata/images/cast/EYE.png" alt="Archive">
        <h4>The Archive</h4>

        <h4>Artificer</h4>
        <p>While she hasn't actually <em>appeared</em> in the story so far, she was depicted, so she's included. She's busy doing sensible things somewhere.</p>
