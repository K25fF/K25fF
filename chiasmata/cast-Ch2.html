                <p class="cast-description">Keeps finding herself stepping between the ‘civilians’ and the immediate source of danger, which is a surprising reflex to have. Isn’t sure where that comes from; the Location offers relatively few pauses for introspection.</p>

Luckily for him, he’s now surrounded by nice people who he’s learning to trust. Unluckily for him, he’s trapped with them in the Location.</p>
